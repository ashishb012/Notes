# Git Status Command

The `git status` command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

## Basic Syntax

```
git status [<options>...]
```

## Common Options

1. `-s, --short`: Give the output in the short-format.
2. `-b, --branch`: Show the branch and tracking info even in short-format.
3. `--show-stash`: Show the number of entries currently stashed away.
4. `--long`: Show the output in the long-format (default).
5. `-v, --verbose`: Be verbose and show the textual changes that are staged.
6. `-u[<mode>], --untracked-files[=<mode>]`: Show untracked files.
   - `no` - Show no untracked files
   - `normal` - Shows untracked files and directories
   - `all` - Also shows individual files in untracked directories
7. `--ignored`: Show ignored files as well.
8. `--ignore-submodules[=<when>]`: Ignore changes to submodules when looking for changes.
   - `none` - Consider submodule modified when it either contains untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded in the superproject
   - `untracked` - Submodules are not considered dirty when they only contain untracked content
   - `dirty` - Ignore all changes to the work tree of submodules
   - `all` - Ignore all changes to submodules
9. `--column[=<options>], --no-column`: Display untracked files in columns.
10. `--ahead-behind`: Display detailed ahead/behind counts for the branch relative to its upstream branch.
11. `--no-ahead-behind`: Do not display detailed ahead/behind counts.
12. `--porcelain[=<version>]`: Give the output in a stable, easy-to-parse format for scripts.
13. `--renames`: Detect renames.
14. `--no-renames`: Do not detect renames.
15. `--find-renames[=<n>]`: Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the similarity threshold.

## Examples

1. Basic status check:
   ```
   git status
   ```

2. Short format status:
   ```
   git status -s
   ```

3. Show branch info in short format:
   ```
   git status -sb
   ```

4. Show ignored files:
   ```
   git status --ignored
   ```

5. Show untracked files, including those in untracked directories:
   ```
   git status -u all
   ```

6. Show status in porcelain format (for scripts):
   ```
   git status --porcelain
   ```

7. Show verbose status with textual changes:
   ```
   git status -v
   ```

8. Show status while ignoring changes in submodules:
   ```
   git status --ignore-submodules=all
   ```

9. Show status with rename detection and a custom similarity threshold:
   ```
   git status --find-renames=70
   ```

## Output Explanation

The output of `git status` typically includes:

1. The current branch and its tracking relationship to the remote.
2. Changes staged for the next commit.
3. Changes not staged for commit (modified files).
4. Untracked files.
5. In case of conflicts, it shows unmerged paths.

Understanding the output of `git status` is crucial for maintaining a clear picture of your repository's state and for deciding what actions to take next in your Git workflow.
